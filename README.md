### Importing lightGallery

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import lightgallery from 'lightgallery'
```

Additionally, you can import lightGallery modules from `dist/plugins`

```javascript
import thumbnails from 'mylib/dist/plugins/thumbnails'
```

### NPM scripts

 - `npm t`: Run test suite
 - `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't

### Automatic releases

_**Prerequisites**: you need to create/login accounts and add your project to:_
 - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
 - [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)

_**Prerequisite for Windows**: Semantic-release uses
**[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)** so you will need to
install
[Microsoft's windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
using this command:_

```bash
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

#### Setup steps

Follow the console instructions to install semantic release and run it (answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?").

_Note: make sure you've setup `repository.url` in your `package.json` file_

```bash
npm install -g semantic-release-cli
semantic-release-cli setup
# IMPORTANT!! Answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?" question. It is already prepared for you
```

From now on, you'll need to use `npm run commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits.

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes your code automatically on [github](https://github.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

### Git Hooks

There is already set a `precommit` hook for formatting your code with Prettier :nail_care:

By default, there are two disabled git hooks. They're set up when you run the `npm run semantic-release-prepare` script. They make sure:
 - You follow a [conventional commit message](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
 - Your build is not going to fail in [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) (or your CI server), since it's runned locally before `git push`

This makes more sense in combination with [automatic releases](#automatic-releases)
